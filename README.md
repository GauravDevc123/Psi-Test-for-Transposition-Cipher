# Psi Test for Transposition Cipher
> A frequency based test to decode the cipherText and get the original plainText.

A brief description of your project, what it is used for and how does life get
awesome when someone starts to use it.

A Psi Test is a test of frequency count to understand how transposition cipherText can be altered in its permutation and the original plainText can be generated.
A text from 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' is used to demonstrate the test and its results. 

## Installing / Getting started

The main.py file can be run on any of the Python IDE or IDLE or through Command Prompt/Shell. 
The text 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' is on the master branch. 

## Formula for Psi Score:

Psi(T)=Æ©(mi^2)/n

Where T -> Permutation, mi -> Frequency of symbol, n -> Number of Symbols
